\begin{abstract}
As quantum computing technologies mature, the energy consumption of fault-tolerant protocols becomes a critical constraint. This paper presents a novel simulation framework that integrates thermodynamic accounting with quantum error correction (QEC) simulations. We analyze the rotated surface code under a depolarizing noise model, estimating the energy cost associated with quantum circuit operations and classical decoding overhead for distances $d \in \{3, 5, 7\}$. Our results demonstrate a clear trade-off: while increasing code distance exponentially suppresses logical errors below the threshold (observed around $p \approx 0.01$), the energy consumption per shot scales quadratically with $d$ and increases with error rate due to decoding complexity. This work underscores the importance of energy-aware QEC design for sustainable large-scale quantum computing.

\section{Introduction}
Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is the holy grail of quantum information science, promising to solve problems intractable for classical computers \cite{shor1994, feynman1982}. To achieve this, Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is required to protect fragile quantum states from environmental noise. The surface code \cite{fowler2012} is a leading candidate for FTQC due to its high error threshold and compatibility with planar qubit architectures.

However, the overhead required for QEC is substantial. A single logical qubit may require thousands of physical qubits and continuous rounds of syndrome measurement and correction. While much research has focused on optimizing error thresholds and reducing qubit counts, the \textit{thermodynamic cost} of these operations---the energy required to drive control lines, perform measurements, and process classical data---is often overlooked. As we scale to millions of physical qubits, the power dissipation of the control electronics and the cryostat cooling load will become limiting factors.

In this work, we introduce a simulation tool that explicitly tracks the energy consumption of QEC cycles. By integrating this "thermodynamic accounting" into standard QEC simulations, we provide a holistic view of the performance-cost trade-offs in FTQC.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Surface Code Simulation}
We simulate the rotated surface code, which encodes one logical qubit into $d^2$ data qubits and $d^2-1$ measurement qubits (ancillas). The distance $d$ determines the code's ability to correct errors, specifically correcting up to $\lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor$ errors.

We utilize the \texttt{Stim} library \cite{gidney2021stim} for high-performance Clifford circuit simulation. The simulation proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Initialization**: Data qubits are initialized in the $|0\rangle$ state.
    \item **Syndrome Extraction**: For $d$ rounds, we measure the $X$ and $Z$ stabilizers. This involves a sequence of Hadamard, CNOT, and measurement operations.
    \item **Decoding**: We collect the detection events (syndrome changes) and use a Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder to predict the error chains. We employ the \texttt{PyMatching} library \cite{higgott2022pymatching} for efficient decoding.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Noise Model}
We assume a standard circuit-level depolarizing noise model parameterized by the physical error rate $p$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Gate Noise**: Each single-qubit and two-qubit gate is followed by a 1-qubit or 2-qubit depolarizing channel with probability $p$.
    \item **Measurement/Reset Noise**: State preparation and measurement (SPAM) operations flip the state with probability $p$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thermodynamic Accounting Model}
To quantify the energy cost, we assign a dimensionless energy cost $E_{op}$ to each fundamental operation type. While these values are illustrative, they reflect relative hardware costs (e.g., measurements and resets are typically slower and more energy-intensive than simple gates). We also introduce a cost for the classical processing required to decode the syndrome, which we model as proportional to the number of detection events (defects).

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Assumed energy costs for physical operations and classical processing.}
    \label{tab:energy_costs}
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Operation} & \textbf{Cost (units)} \\
        \midrule
        Single-qubit Gate (H, S, etc.) & 1.0 \\
        Two-qubit Gate (CNOT) & 2.0 \\
        Measurement (M) & 5.0 \\
        Reset (R) & 3.0 \\
        Decoding Event Processing (per defect) & 20.0 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The total energy $E_{total}$ for a simulation shot is the sum of circuit operation costs and the decoding cost:
\begin{equation}
    E_{total} = \sum_{i} N_i \cdot E_{op, i} + N_{defects} \cdot E_{decoding}
\end{equation}
where $N_i$ is the count of operation type $i$, $N_{defects}$ is the number of detection events in the shot, and $E_{decoding}$ is the cost per defect.

\section{Results}
We performed Monte Carlo simulations for code distances $d \in \{3, 5, 7\}$ sweeping the physical error rate $p$ from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$. Each point represents 10,000 shots.

\subsection{Logical Error Rates and Threshold}
Figure \ref{fig:threshold} displays the logical error rate $P_L$ as a function of the physical error rate $p$. We observe the characteristic threshold behavior. For low error rates ($p < 0.01$), the logical error rate decreases with increasing distance $d$. The intersection of the curves suggests a threshold near $p \approx 1\%$, consistent with standard surface code literature.

    \caption{Logical error rate vs. physical error rate for code distances $d=3, 5, 7$. The crossover indicates the accuracy threshold.}
    \label{fig:threshold}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Energy Consumption Scaling}
Figure \ref{fig:energy} shows the average energy consumption per shot as a function of the physical error rate. The energy cost includes both a static component (circuit operations) and a dynamic component (decoding effort). As expected, the energy scales strongly with distance $d$. Furthermore, as the physical error rate $p$ increases, the number of defects rises, leading to a visible increase in the decoding energy required.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{energy_plot.png}
    \caption{Total energy consumption per shot vs. physical error rate $p$ for code distances $d=3, 5, 7$. The baseline energy is determined by the circuit depth and size (scaling $\sim O(d^2)$), while the increase with $p$ reflects the additional classical processing cost for decoding syndrome defects.}
    \label{fig:energy}
\end{figure}

This result highlights that operating below the threshold is not only beneficial for accuracy but also for energy efficiency in the classical control layer, as fewer errors mean less decoding work.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have demonstrated a framework for co-simulating QEC performance and energy consumption. Our results highlight the steep energy penalty associated with increasing code distance and the additional cost incurred by classical decoding as error rates rise. Future work will refine the energy model to include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cryogenic Overhead}: Converting dissipated heat at millikelvin temperatures to wall-plug power (typically a factor of 1000x or more).
    \item \textbf{Idle Power}: Static power consumption of qubits and control lines.
\end{itemize}
Addressing these thermodynamic constraints will be as crucial as improving gate fidelities for the realization of practical quantum computers.
